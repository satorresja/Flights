In order to run our application, we need to follow the next instructions:

1. Install docker
2. Build our applications with the code line:
  ```bash
  docker-compose build
  ```
  followed by the line:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```
 
You will see something like this:

```bash
(Newshore) âžœ  Newshore git:(main) docker-compose up
